Plant a seed in the soil.  
Water it down with the apt amount  
With a committed routine.  
Put some manure and dry humus  
And let the seed sprout to life  
In a green tiny sapling.  
It will be long, very long,  
To be honest.  
Hold yourself through the journey  
And one day a flower will face the sun  
On this same plant  
In its pride.  
Let go of the expectation  
To be remembered  
For when you watered that seed  
And it sprouted a green life  
You were happy for eternity  
In that moment.  

Dragon.
