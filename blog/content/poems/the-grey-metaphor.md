Such is love!  
A charisma of survival  
Like that couple wallpaper  
From the movie Up.  

Such is love!  
Isn't it amazing that what's  
Quite simple  
Is most difficult to understand  
And vibe with.  
Grasping it takes a lifetime.  
I used to wonder why  
Most of the poetry I read  
Has been written about love  
Which became repetitive  
After a while.  

Such is love!  
It makes us smile like idiots  
Without any particular reason  
It makes us feel THAT GOOD  
An LSD trip till it begins to suffer.  
Love gives us truckload of expectations  
And these expectations bring  
Shitloads of pain and trauma.  

Such is love!  
A blessing only when love  
Sprouts unconditionally  
Without any hope for reciprocation  
Without any hope for acknowledgement  
Because we humans are ironic  
We value things  
When we have lost them.
