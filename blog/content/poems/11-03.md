Yo  
I got eyes and ears everywhere  
I see as high as the sky is  
See a tick on an eagle feather  
I hear with elephant ears  
Hyena demeanor  
Sink my teeth deep in wildebeest and eat up  
I been a king of the animal kingdom  
Bring some bags of money  
Handle with a green-some sum  
Thoughts of a venom abandoned with a machine gun  
Of-course, 'cause I'm a product of where I came from  
I'm still mourning losses, still traumatized  
My psychological trauma is now monetized  
My life in a rap song is idolised  
The price of that rap song ask spotify  
People opinion don't faze me  
Dislikes don't dissuade me  
Even when they try to paint me  
Out to be something i'm not, i stay me  
I ain't scared to be alone or with a lot of people  
Great experience provoke I get a lot from either  
Getting closer to my goal  
Rest in peace stan lee  
I'm Peter parker, Lamborghini by the parking meter, start the beeper

I will let my pain  
Kill me  
Within  
Everyday  
I won't let it stop me  
From smoking my cigarette  
I will channelize  
My energy  
Into everything positive  
Every art  
Every moment  
Every laugh  
I will never  
Commit suicide  
I can only be  
Murdered.  

Dragon.
