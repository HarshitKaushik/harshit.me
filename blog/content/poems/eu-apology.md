"बुरा जो देखन मैं चला, बुरा न मिलिया कोय |  
जो दिल खोजा आपना, मुझसे बुरा न कोय ||"  

-कबीर

There was a poem by Kamala Das. The poem is about her mother at the age of sixty-six and her own dilemma looking the approaching death in the face. This poem is a bit of my heart and a bit of my regret inspired by the same poem and my grandfather's memory.

(Eu/Apo)logy

I felt close to my grandfather as a child.  
I didn't belong to a family of readers  
And he alone with a temperament so mild  
And calm like a forest of cedars  

Enlightened me to a simple realization  
That knowledge neither belongs to vaults   
Nor to a greedy collector's big accumulation  
Nor to prizes that sit with old malts  

Nor to a poor man's misery and poignancy  
Nor to a rich man's deep shiny pockets  
Nor to an anxious mind wrecked in emergency  
Nor to secrets buried in lost treasure lockets.  

He would read. With vigour and with ardour  
Each book he could lay his hands on.  
Books that smelled of trouble and rigour.  
Plastered sculptures of wise minds broken  

Into stones. Each book that belonged to young  
Kids that went to school and pre-school  
For a mind often breaks up when strung  
Around mundane life forgetting to be a fool  

Some times. An engineer for the military he was.  
Yet he didn't let his life behold him.  
Retired years later and a farmer he was  
Working on his land. Sacrificed his dream  

Or maybe he had to. Who now knows (He knows!).  
We never talked about it. Only about  
The lost poems, the stories and the visited cities.  
A decade passed and I heard about your bout.  

As life happened and I shivered to adjust  
To the societal norms that weigh a man  
By his monetary prowess while eradicating  
Any worth that an A4 with words written  

On it. You asked about my earning and I snapped  
At you. I snapped at someone I hold so close.  
It wasn't you. It was money. I never shared  
My earnings with anyone. Nobody knows.  

The sheer weight of the influence it holds  
To change people with time, with circumstance  
Makes me disgust the dignity it beholds  
Hurting even loved ones on my circumference.  

Dragon apologizes. Dragon remembers you.  
This erroneous experience I put you through.
