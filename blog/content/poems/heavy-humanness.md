I see two birds fighting over their share of seeds  
They pick on their feathers, squirming and chasing.  
The hatchlings sleep hungry over these deeds  
As the enemies wither and roll back to defacing.  

A worm infests a host slowly day by day, every day,  
Feeding on the blood, the worth and the happiness.  
Wounds ooze fresh when betrayals kill the prey;  
Size doesn't matter when battling intense deadliness.  

A dog howls few marks of enigmatic honesty  
Bonding with a soul deeper than Shepherd's tree.  
Yet when an injured mouse, recent amputee,  
Surfaces, innocence turns red with the devil's eye.
