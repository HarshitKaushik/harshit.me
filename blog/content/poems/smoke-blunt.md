Burdened bloodied burrows,  
A prairie dog proceeds to-  
Commit infanticide again.  
Rogue worker ant bursts open  
In a suicidal bit to-  
Even up with the soldiers.  
Lavish suffocating rooms  
Make space for worldly chatter  
Balcony breathes-  
A recluse's solitude in smoke.  
If in power, decapitated heads  
Of the de-foresters-  
Stare into eyes of Ma Bufang.  

Dragon.
