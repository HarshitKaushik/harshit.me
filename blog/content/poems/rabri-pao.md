I stood near Sarnath in northeast Varanasi  
Devouring on a plate of Rabri Pao  
Again and again for a while.  
Cooked on coal, it tasted divine.  
Now, that image flickers in my mind  
During late-night contemplations.  
Maybe, I would have decided that  
This Universe is a pitiless place  
And for all its glamour, all its glitz,  
Nihilistic oblivion with no meaning.  
Truth is a bit like coal.  

Dragon.
