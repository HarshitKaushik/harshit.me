The doctor offered my father a choice.  
The newborn or the lovely wife?  
My father broke and couldn't choose.  
The doctor took a risky undertaking  
Cutting out the belly with surgical precision  
Saving me and my mother.  
I was born from a lifelong scar  
And I taught myself to love  
All the scars.  

I got smallpox when I was a young kid.  
The same disease which wreaked havoc  
In Native America some hundreds  
Of years ago.  
It decimated and wiped off  
Entire communities.  
Tell me again how science  
Doesn't improve our lives?  

I grew up and got Typhoid  
Admitted to a hospital for a week  
I learnt how most nurses  
Hail from Kerala.  
Also, I kept this as a reminder   
That our rivers are polluted,  
Our groundwater is polluted,  
And our ponds are gone.  

Intoxicated with smoke and leaves  
Driving a bike and met an accident  
Just before reaching National Highway.  
Escaped death from my high-way  
And learnt that carelessness is not fun  
Nor is thoughtlessness.  
(Never (drink/smoke) and drive.)  

Sitting in the backseat of a big car  
Leaving for an exciting trip  
Witnessed a road accident  
And the driver raced the car  
In fear and trepidation  
Coming face to face with  
A speeding truck  
Coming in the wrong direction.  

Dragon.
