You complain that I'm angry  
A bit withered after all the years  
That is slipping away  
Slowly.  

But am I? Isn't it true  
That we become angry with people  
We cared about  
Otherwise, it's apathy  
Not anger that is seeping in  
Slowly.  

The truth is I'm not even angry  
I was most probably back then  
Yet the anger seems  
Like longing for acknowledgement  
Fading in  
Slowly.  

Dragon.
