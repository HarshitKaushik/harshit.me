How do you become a God?  
Be Shiva  
Destroyer of toxic things  
Vibes and people.  
Be Krishna  
Preserver of good things  
Things that make you happy  
Even if they don't  
Survive through them  
They will eventually make you happy  
Be Brahma  
A creator  
Write because you have to write  
Read because you have to read  
Draw because you feel to  
Dance for no reason  
Anything you do  
Do it with no expectations  
With a bit of love  
And a shit load of hard work  
Breaths of passion.  

Dragon.
