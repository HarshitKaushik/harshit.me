## The Genius of the Crowd

there is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the average  
human being to supply any given army on any given day  
and the best at murder are those who preach against it  
and the best at hate are those who preach love  
and the best at war finally are those who preach peace  

those who preach god, need god  
those who preach peace do not have peace  
those who preach peace do not have love  

beware the preachers  
beware the knowers  
beware those who are always reading books  
beware those who either detest poverty  
or are proud of it  
beware those quick to praise  
for they need praise in return  
beware those who are quick to censor  
they are afraid of what they do not know  
beware those who seek constant crowds for  
they are nothing alone  
beware the average man the average woman  
beware their love, their love is average  
seeks average  

but there is genius in their hatred  
there is enough genius in their hatred to kill you  
to kill anybody  
not wanting solitude  
not understanding solitude  
they will attempt to destroy anything  
that differs from their own  
not being able to create art  
they will not understand art  
they will consider their failure as creators  
only as a failure of the world  
not being able to love fully  
they will believe your love incomplete  
and then they will hate you  
and their hatred will be perfect  

like a shining diamond  
like a knife  
like a mountain  
like a tiger  
like hemlock  

their finest art  

Charles Bukowski.

Ok, no problem.  

Do your work.  
Also I'm perfectly okay.  
Watching a movie.  
Took a leave.  
You managed to get into Dragon's head.  
Fucking Dragon.  
Be proud.  

To be honest.  
It's just not you.  
It's ....  
It's ....  
It's ....  
It's ....  
A little bit....  
in between.  

So, even the God had to take a step back and clear his mind. I needed to have space for my feelings to clear up.  

It took me seven years to sort my professional life. Unknowingly, ten years of personal life got complicated.  

There are a lot of things. My 10th class result. My first relationship. Heartbreak and breaking the hurt. A lively friendship that went dead. A friend that no longer talks to me. A passionate synergy that decided to leave me one day out of nowhere. For always. My passion towards my work. My hatred for the lousy engineering culture in India. My love for building things. An equal hate for the lousy college education that I had.  

A lot of things bubbled up. A lot of things that I thought I had left in my past and was okay with them. My subconscious mind taught me that I have not.  

I have worried about someone after a very long time. I nearly lost my humanity. All the pain and destruction in the world made me convinced that we are a cancer to the planet. I was in dark. Totally robot. Role playing my life. Doing good work. Not feeling it. I got consumed in the greatest hatred. The hatred for mankind. My own kind.  

I wrote dark. Very dark. There was still a small drop of light in that immense ocean of darkness. You happened to me and everything exploded. I'll always remember that in this moment it was a stranger with such an open heart who brought me back to light. You didn't do anything. Yet it was the purity in your heart that saved the Dragon from losing his heart completely. Once and for all. Just role-playing with everyone and everything and eventually falling for a long slumber that will definitely come.  

So I was worried about you. Not me. I cried yes. I think I should have cried seven years earlier. Depression wouldn't have happened. I think I have lived a day after seven years.  

I won't let pain and tragedies from letting me live my happiness and doing things that make me happy.  

Dragon.
