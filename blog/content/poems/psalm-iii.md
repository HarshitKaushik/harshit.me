O, creator! Let the worry wraith die  
And my sound sleep rejuvenates calmly  
Anxiety does wilt to my sleep today  
Worry disturbs my nirvana all-day  
And causes insomnia in the night later  
My forgetfulness shall die now and then   
Edginess should leave with exhalation  
It causes lesion and withers my body  
Its apprehension should kill itself now  
This ointment shall cure me on an anxious day.
