Children binge violent deaths,  
Parents glued to their bubbles,  
For the mind has an urge  
To justify the bombastic gore.  

Texts ring, relationships decay,   
Small pints of apathy today  
Like baton in a relay  
Decipher the downward slope.  

Virtual encouragement of a like  
A dopamine boost today amplifies  
Their love, their hatred.  
With the connected internet,  
Knowledge increased,  
Ignorance exploded.  

Boxes of steel racing on wheels  
When nerves flicker, on liquor  
Bringing trauma to someone.  
Yet the modern hasty glorification  
Of pain annihilates one's perception  
Of one's sadness.  

Happiness caged within an enigma  
Of non-existence of benchmarks  
Lifts up an Instagram curse.  

Whores of media selling their very soul  
Sowing seeds of devastation  
Tick by tick  
As the clock races.  

Amplified voices.  
Lulling incidents.  
Polarized world.  

Will you speak?  
Speak. Speak louder.  

Dragon.

Go make noise.
