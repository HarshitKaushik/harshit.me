Please know  
I'll find my love  
In your hatred  
For my own  
Principles.  

I'm a lethal combination  
Of violence and peace.  

The violence of the sheer ability  
To reject your hatred  
No matter why  
No matter where.  

Also, don't expect replies  
I thought about spending a  
Pico-second  
But it got expensive.  

Dragon.
