A garden, segregated by the colour of leaves  
Squirms within with a frown of distaste  
As two ferns grow in humiliating proximity.  
In an abyss of hatred the flora grieves.  
Police-plants prepare offence in haste  
Assuming normality from overall absurdity.  

Ferns don't grow flowers; Definitely right!  
If you break the lamps, then, light a candle  
Masquerading as the saviour we asked for  
You can definitely claim, there is a bright light.  
Sometimes, the glory lies in the scandal  
Because we can't take reality anymore.  

Dragon.
