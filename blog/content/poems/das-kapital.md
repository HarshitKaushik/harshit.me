"Communism failed in real life because humans like to own things."  
-Anonymous  

___

I was in a high-profile marriage once. My father was working with a builder and was invited to his son's wedding. I accompanied him to the place because I was curious. Unlike middle-class weddings, they had their guests sitting in small groups in separate lavish rooms while a separate receptionist catered to each. A beautiful place. People wearing their best. As time passed, I had my dinner and moved towards the stage. There I saw it.

Four girls painted in green paint completely from their hair to toes dressed like sisters of Statue Of Liberty stood on the corners of the stage. Two on each side. They stood like a statue slowly moving their hands in a circular motion while water fell from above. Moving statues. Yet everything went ahead as if they were not even there. Such is the disgusting face of Capitalism. The World Order. As it exists.

In that night of celebration, watching them stand like that for hours was a poignant sight. A sight of how poor people can be traumatized and forced to do disgusting tasks. You see, Capitalism is a neat trick. The Third World War has already happened. Capitalism defeated Communism. How else do you convince a woman to work as a house help for your family? How else will you convince a man to pull a Rickshaw to drop you home? How else will you convince a man to mend your shoes all his life? How else will you convince a man to sweat in fields so that one can eat? How else will you convince a man to clean the sanitation systems? Poverty is not an accident. It has been there for centuries in every culture and every civilization because of a simple reason.

You see, living is not a glorious task. It's tedious. A lot of work and a lot of chores. You don't see animals maintaining an economic system. Humans evolved to have one. In every culture, some sections of people had to be made miserable enough so that they'll do all the work. The comfort of the few has always come at the cost of the most. Any part of the world. Any culture.

Yet, the paradox. One of the most horrible inventions of mankind became the sole reason for World Peace since World War 2. Humans are a warring species. We have been fighting bloody and brutal wars with each other for centuries. World War 2 was the bloodiest man conflict in history. Millions died. But. The wars became too much expensive. The weapons became too much destructive. The overall economic loss of a modern war avoided the conflicts that could have pushed the world into a third nuclear war. Nuclear torpedoes all around the world beneath the oceans became a reason for the peace. Unfortunately and fortunately. It was only Capitalism and Globalisation that made it stupid to go to a bloody war.

In an ideal world, we would have been whiter than we really are. I would have been a communist in such a utopia. But that's the catch.Â 

No utopia exists.


# Das Kapital

The dignity of a man, drawn from his pockets,  
Delineate the treatment he "deserves".  
Mightier its weight, more the Virtue skyrockets,  
An existential World Order, the society preserves.  

Bigoted talks of Morality long beheaded  
By the acceptance of normalcy that shivers  
From the dread that even a minute awakening  
May totally annihilate. Darkened actuators  

Of a system that churns more than it serves.  
A felony. A lip-service sweetened by blood  
And sweat of the Proletarians - the slaves  
Of the Bourgeoisie. Dreams soaked in mud.  

Deceit like a masquerade of an honour  
Seldom will choose in a utopian world.  
Biased payments to live while a shareowner  
Makes them dance to the music that unfurled  

When the Few decided to reward the Most.  

Dragon.
