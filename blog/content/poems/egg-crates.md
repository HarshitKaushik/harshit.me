I buy two egg crates for the n-th time.  
Thinking how eating ten eggs a day  
Will cover up the eggs before  
They finally run afoul.  
I charge my kindle with a plain hope  
Of reading it before it gets discharged.  
I smuggle more audiobooks  
On Audible.  
There is a mountain of paperbacks  
That breathes a sigh and grows higher.  
I wake up late.  
The phone rings and rings,  
The pings start smashing on the screen.  
I boil five eggs and start working,  
I think I'll eat lunch at mid-day.  
The heart races, the clock races faster.  
I stumble, I struggle. It's 3 PM.  
I eat my boiled eggs looking at the gym kit  
Staring me like my father.  
I eat lunch and go back to work.  
It's 12 AM.  
My mother comes again and leaves the room.  
I eat dinner. I wonder if kindle has discharged yet,  
I glance at the GoPro looking at me  
Like a dog yearning for a bright day walk.  
I ignore the stack of newspapers that hold me  
Hostage to news now dead in the oblivion.  
I eat my dinner and browse few poems  
Thinking I'll go through Nightwriter's all works  
One day and we'll chat about each poem.  
I look at my sleeping father. How was the day?  
He doesn't reply.  
I sleep.  
Eggs don't run out in one week.  
I dump one crate.  
The pandemic is still bad.  

Dragon.
