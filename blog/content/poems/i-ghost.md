I ghost my emotions.  
I ghost.  
Most of the time, I ghost my emotions.  
I'm at a donation camp donating blood  
To save a mother battling death,  
I observe them gaslighting hospital papers  
And I rebuke them ruthlessly  
With an iron fist.  
Emotions ain't worth shit if you end up  
Killing the person you're so  
Desperately trying to save.  

I ghost my emotions.  
I ghost.  
I'm the youngest in my extended family.  
They want me to start a family.  
How do I tell them about child beggars  
Who don't vacate my mind?  
They'll say they're not mine.  
Why the heck do I care?  
I smoke my last puff. Breathe deep.  
And let the smoke leave slowly.  

I ghost my emotions.  
I ghost.  
Have you felt lonely?  
So lonely that even sadness feels nothing.  
Desperately looking for answers  
That no one is looking for.  
Failing to believe in a God who sounds  
Contradictory to a world of suffering.  
You breathe nihilism.  
Still, a young kid smiles and conflicts  
That peace too.  

I ghost my emotions.  
I ghost.
