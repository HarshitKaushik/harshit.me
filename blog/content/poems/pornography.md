Fast-flipping frames of grid-arranged cubes  
Subjugate the echo of a feeling  
Much like modern cinema  
Castrates the audacity of this fluid  
With chemical receptors  
Of experiencing an "experience".  

Carrying a thin veil of existence  
That grows subduing the soul food.  
Aren't people like pornography?  
Loud and enslaved decrepit wells  
With water beyond their stones  
Blurred and forgotten.  

Some walk over a thin line between  
Admirers of innocence and killers of childhood  
Penetrating the death of humanity  
While they witness a million clicks.  
Chased and hunted, seeping deep into the  
Immortal, untraceable, yet very existing  
Roots of the internet.  

Strings of fantasies vibrating to a truce  
Between a digital and fabricated escape  
And a fading reality.  
Throngs of bodies wanking to loneliness  
As they shudder  
Deep into the reasonable scams.  

Some let the expression of pain be a symbol  
Of their subjugation to a dominant one.  
Phoney commotion, plastic on the face,  
On the bosom, on the feeling of union.  
Drugs promulgated as messiahs to insecurities  
Killing them inside.  

Is it too much to ask for different?  
Maybe, I admire the sensation of a touch  
Down my spine  
Than a thrust in your clit.  
When we meet,  
Know, maybe I'm weak.  

Dragon.
