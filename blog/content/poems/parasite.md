This poem is inspired from Bong Joon-Ho's satirical masterpiece Parasite and a parallel theme of mental health.

I thought I won't write dark. Yet I feel dark. Dark. Also, it depends on the reader's perspective.

Happy Dangerously Dangerous New Year.

Parasite                                             

I light a cigarette, pass it to my Comrade,  
We both stare into the full moon in the sky.  
The smoke gushes burning the Vantablack chad  
Built by unreachable celestial brain fry.  

How did it feel a decade ago? I ask him.  
Seeing your mother hanging a rope 'round the fan  
Leading a young kid drowning deep into grim  
Seas of melancholy in a cold mid-Jan.  

He passes the Cig. I close my eyes and pull  
White intellect deep into my alveoli,  
Trying to weigh the moment that I can't mull.  
He sighs and reflects trying not to petrify  

The struggling man inside the coffin of a boy  
As tears come rolling down from red stoner eyes.  
It happens when ten years of fears do destroy  
The peace of soul. A man breathes and daily dies.  

Oh you depressed b*tch, please shut the f**k up!  
He cries and shouts deep into the 3 AM void.  
I see the pain from painstakingly real closeup,  
Empathetic to real-life dilemma's Iloyd.  

So sad about the boring life, you today, huh?  
When procrastinating whole night to an iPad  
Destroying our Lebanon with your Hezbollah  
Every day, you b*tch, every day for a decade.  

Can't find a meaning! Yeah, sure! In the arms  
Of cosy cotton blankets and a warm supper vibe.  
Building castles of air on nonexistent farms  
Not a f**king contribution I could ascribe.  

Taking our empathy for leverage in your negotiations,  
Taking our pain for a trophy of your felonies,  
Taking our fear for your weakness abbreviations,   
Taking our strength for mileage for your tyrannies.  

Comrade throws the dying Cig in a nearby dustbin  
And looks again at the full moon, God's allograph,   
You come and slap him in the face remindin'  
Him that Cancer is death. Comrade laughs. I laugh.  

Dragon.
