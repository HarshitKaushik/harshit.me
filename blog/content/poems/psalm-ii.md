O, creator! In the race of success  
Sanctify those who are in front of me  
That they remain in place, not petrify  
Sanctify those who are behind me now  
That they progress restricting sterile way  
Sanctify me too that, with all my strength  
I shall try not to breathe in a blithe way  
And try to get even with those persons  
Who are still in front of me this today  
This ointment shall cure me in a hopeless day.
