Tell me what you gon' do to me  
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me  
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword  
Bring a morgue, but you can't bring the truth to me  
F**k you and all your expectations  
I don't even want your congratulations  
I recognize your false confidence and calculated promises all in your conversations  
I hate people that feel entitled  
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you  
Oh, you important?  
You the moral to the story, you endorsing?  
Motherf**ker, I don't even like you  
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift  
That's how you find out who you dealin' with  
A small percentage, who I'm building with  
I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning  
On my momma that's the realest shit!  

-Kendrick Lamar

How many things should I be sorry for?  
Time spent to polish my skills with depth pretty deep?  
Or the costs paid for the promises I did keep?  
Or the nights spent working when I didn't sleep?  
Or the years of sweat and blood that I now reap?  

You ask me to care, give a dime  
About judgements, they've already made,  
About hatred, they've already spewed,  
About agendas, they have in minds,  
About negative vibes that I don't deserve.  

Tell me again,  
How many things I should be sorry for?  
Deep attachments that they call cheap?  
Or the promises that I bled to keep?  
Or falls from the mountains very steep?  
That broke my bones with cracks very deep?  
Or the years of sweat and blood that I now reap?  

Dragon.
