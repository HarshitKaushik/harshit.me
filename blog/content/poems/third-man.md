I gesture a direction with my hand  
Making eye contact with the driver.  
The autorickshaw stops and no one  
Says anything.  

The autorickshaw is full. Four in the back.  
One on each side of the driver in the front.  
I make eye contact with the side fellow.  
He grunts and moves closer to the driver.  
Then, I tag along.  

I observe that the guy is a labourer  
Ferrying to his destination in the morning.  
He adjusts to make me feel comfortable.  
I forget he is poor.  
He forgets I am rich.  
We both hustle together.
