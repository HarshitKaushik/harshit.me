Tell me  
Have you ever wondered?  
How technically same  
A black hole is to sadness  
A star is to happiness  

Every star collapses  
Eventually to a black hole  
Everything even light  
Collapses into the black hole  

Let us shine  
Let us shine  
Let us shine together  
Let there be only one  
Last ultimate black hole  

I'm a firefly yes  
But never forget  
I'm a dragon first  
A fire-breathing  
Destroying  
Dragon  
Annihilation  
Total absolute annihilation  

Read about the suns  
Read about the black holes  
And then stop thinking  
If God exists anymore.  

Dragon.
