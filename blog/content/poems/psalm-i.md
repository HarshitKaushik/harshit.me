O, creator! Bestow a golden effect  
Salutary works I shall do today  
Encourage my soul to learn from failure  
Encourage my voice to hearten others  
May I inhale love and exhale hatred  
May I taste and sense positivity  
Stimulate my body, heart ne'er exhaust  
Animate my failed endeavours always  
Encourage me to enlighten this world  
This ointment shall cure me on a woeful day.  

Dragon.
