16-bit Intel 8088 chip

with an Apple Macintosh
you can't run Radio Shack programs
in its disc drive.
nor can a Commodore 64
drive read a file
you have created on an
IBM Personal Computer.
both Kaypro and Osborne computers use
the CP/M operating system
but can't read each other's
handwriting
for they format (write
on) discs in different
ways.
the Tandy 2000 runs MS-DOS but
can't use most programs produced for
the IBM Personal Computer
unless certain
bits and bytes are
altered
but the wind still blows over
Savannah
and in the Spring
the turkey buzzard struts and
flounces before his
hens.

-Charles Bukowski

### 16 GB

We live in an age  
Where we have feelings about our "feelings".  
We carry 16 GB Pen Drive around  
Wishing to accommodate  
Images that capture our "moments",  
Videos that live our "stories",  
PDFs that have "knowledge"  
We will never open twice,  
Closeness slave to "pixelated lovemaking",  
Songs that don't aid our "listening".  
Yet we haven't managed  
To breathe in our 16 GB.  

Dragon
