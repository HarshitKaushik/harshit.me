Every day, we have a choice. Either to make things better or to make things worse.

# Roots

Ancestral home stands in ruins, desolated.  
A mud edifice,Â reminiscent now  
Of a grandfather, I never met abated  
In the roots of blood, crops and a plough.  

A story like our very own nation back then,  
Young, poor, socialist trying to make a way.  
Five offsprings. Urban-settled women and men.  
Their young, hair either lost or grown grey.  

Does the world opinion of a story matter  
If it means the "meaning" to you.
