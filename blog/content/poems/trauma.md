There is an emptiness  
In the bedsheets in the morning  
When looked from a distance  
A star glistens with light  
From a crowd  
Yet if we can feel at the right scale  
A star carries a void  
Omnipresent for hundreds  
Of light-years.  

There was an emptiness  
Even when the pots found a way  
Around the cracks  
Corpses smile from buried caskets  
Enough times that we forget  
How it felt to be breathing.  

There will be an emptiness  
When the winter shrouds the landscape  
Everything you touch ruins  
And decays  
Leaving a void in its place  
That cannot be filled  
No matter how much we try.  

Dragon.
