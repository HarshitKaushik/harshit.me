Filicide is the deliberate act of a parent killing their own child. The word filicide is derived from the Latin words filius and filia (son and daughter) and the suffix -cide, meaning to kill, murder, or cause death. The word can refer both to the crime and to the perpetrator of the crime.

Worst case.

### Filicide

A poem begins like an infant spick-and-span.  
Initially, inside your influence and control,  
Gradually, discovering a life of its own  
Sometimes, in hands of radicals who extol  
It so much forcing filicide out of your control.
