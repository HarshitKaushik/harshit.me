It is mid-October again. There are two stubbles.  
One that makes us look good.  
Another that every year bubbles  
From the plight of those who provide us food.  
The winds are on death bed in the doldrums  
Smoke rises and clouds the horizon  
Or is it smog? Forgive me for missing fulcrums  
That I haven't used. It is just not fun.  
Stubble burns long enough in the fields  
To make the weather feel cloudy  
But with no winds. It just yields  
Enough suffocation and misery  
To remind us all that the farmers  
Aren't the only ones who are dying,  
In the winters and in the summers  
Aren't the only ones who are dying.  
A profession kept on poverty's pedestal  
A sign of not urbane and educated status.  
A mirage for those who have had such colossal  
Impact feeding the nation since it was a fetus.  
The hardest working workers willing to will  
Even after living through the disappointments.  
Politicians disappear, making the seasonal kill.   
This smoke sickens the children, you say,  
Then hop onto your tweet screens.  
Let me ask a question if I may?  
When the government scans  
The uncompliant farmers this year  
Without beating them into fear  
Sit with them, smoke a bidi, ask them  
How much debt do they carry?   

Dragon.
