With time I learnt to have space  
For myself and the person I am  
Involved with.  
The deep roots of a huge green tree  
Run deep into the capacity  
To accommodate an individuality.  
I didn't compare you with anyone.  
Did I?  

We each have our pros and our cons,  
Our emotions, our mannerisms, our beliefs,  
Our strengths and our shortcomings.  
I treated you like a whole.  
Improving our synergy,  
Resolving our conflicts,   
Through mutual respect,   
Understanding and willingness  
To arrive  
At some common ground.  
You took my space for a ground  
To fly your flights of carelessness.  
You took me for granted repeatedly  
And it felt like I was the only one  
Who was supposed to carry the weight  
Of our relationship.  

Water crops for the dry summer 
And you will return  
To reap the yields.  
In the end, I chose to lose you  
Because my individuality isn't a sacrifice  
To accommodate yours.  
Remember, when you keep singing   
That I left,  
Remember, it was a calculated decision.
