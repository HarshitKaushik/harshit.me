What Have I Learnt From My Leaders?

A great leader I know who leads a software engineering team on a global Software As A Service offering at a reputed international company was promoted as a Director of Product and Engineering. One thing that puzzled me was that he mentioned his leaders from the past in the reply to corporate congratulatory email and offered gratitude towards them but the leaders were neither in the corporate network nor in the recipients at that time. I thought that a lot of recipients wouldn’t even notice and the leaders might never know that they were mentioned.

I think there is a good thing about this. What is better than an unconditional grateful remembrance of business leaders who shape your ideology and habits. So, here are the five things that I have learnt from my leaders over the last five years and how I am trying to imbibe them and move towards better leadership.

## Don’t lose professional integrity as an empathetic leader.

I have learnt this from a very experienced leader who is empathetic and has led teams over the years. Yet, empathy with your team should not come at the cost of professional integrity. For example, some domains in the industry need ruthless code ethic because of the criticality and you cannot compromise on them. Information Security can never be “convenient”.

## Team comes first.

One thing that I have admired was the energetic and inclusive environment we built in our culture at Kwench that focused on the cumulative strengths of the team and the cumulative weaknesses of the team that we should focus on. It wouldn’t have been possible without the right seeds planted and nurtured by the management leaders that built closely-knit teams of highly-driven individuals across various functions. It also depends on the mindset and behaviour of fellow team members and how they elevate the existing culture and make it awesome.

## Trust your new team members more than they deserve right now.

A team is always evolving. Old members may leave, change teams and migrate to another function. We should trust our new team members more than they deserve right now because if we don’t take that leap of faith, the team member will feel intimidated and not driven. My leaders had more faith in me at times than I deserved. We all work. We all make mistakes. We all grow through them. Sincerity shouldn’t mean professional rudeness.

## Introspection starts within.

A great, young and dynamic leader I know has this “one great thing”. The ability to start with yourself when you introspect current realities, strengths and weaknesses. The current bottlenecks towards a more fulfilling and beautiful professional experience. It is easy to poke holes here and there but it takes a lot to take initiative and solve a problem with solving-problem attitude. We should work as a team and figure out the bottlenecks as a team.

## Ego is your enemy, engineer!

There is a positive ego that can shield you from unnecessary and unfounded criticism and complaints but ego overall is a big player in blinding a leader from reflecting deep into reality. A business is built by people and run by people. That takes people with different experiences from different backgrounds and different domains uniting under a single objective. Also, as an engineer, we cannot afford to be egotistic because that will lead to our solutions not connecting with the mainstream audience.

Thank you. I have been lucky to learn good things from good people. Looking forward to where life leads us now.

Harshit.
