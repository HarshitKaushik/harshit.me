When we talk about remuneration for software engineer jobs, a segment of people only considers the experience's monetary aspect. Software engineer jobs are among the most sought and difficult professions to make a career and stay relevant in right now. Money matters!

Unfortunately, it also shapes this peer pressure inside the industry to be always conscious of your current remuneration as a proxy of "quality of software engineering and system design skills" and a strong factor which builds a strong imposter syndrome and sometimes, hinders our satisfaction in the job. We also belong to an industry infamous for job-hopping and hard-to-retain talent.

We forget that the remuneration of a software engineer for his work does not depend on just one factor: the quality and quantity of work s/he is doing. It is a complex equation with multiple factors involved. The cost of living of the place where the software engineer is based. The financial capacity of the employer. The kind, difficulty and depth of work. How "easily replaceable" that professional is in the currently available industry (if needed). The stream of the software industry the software engineer is involved in. The perception of that stream of the software industry on the employers and recruiters. The criticality of hiring and the temporal importance of the work then.

I don't know why but a React engineer commands some degree of premium over an Angular engineer. (This can be a personal and subjective experience and possibly incorrect.) An experienced software engineer freelancing in embedded C programming commands a big premium at Upwork simply because good embedded C programmers are very rare and difficult to replace in the market. An ambitious startup with recently infused large sums of capital will possibly pay a premium for a software engineer's work not just because his skills have possibly improved over time but also because it needs good engineers and it is building a new team. Some decent companies with a very good culture simply do not have the deep pockets of Fortune 500 companies to match their pay brackets. A company might be paying a premium for a software engineer job from earnings from other verticals of business. The industry and the circumstances are continuously evolving.

I like to think of it as a Tablewaala dilemma. Say you work in a music band and you have worked hard over the years to be a good Tabla musician. Now, no matter how hard you work and how good you are at Tabla, your remuneration will possibly never match what the Guitar guy is making. That should not affect you and decrease your happiness if it is playing the Tabla that brings your greater satisfaction and happiness.

I do not like Ustad Bismillah Khan's Shehnai instrumentals and can't bear it for long. It doesn't change the fact that he was indeed an Ustad and a revered musician in the world and had millions of fans. It is just my subjective experience.

Some of us grow with time and eventually learn that when the basic necessities and an acceptable living standard is met and you're spending eight hours in front of a screen each day every week, it becomes ridiculously difficult to maintain a high level of engagement and work satisfaction and the money paid is just one of the deciding factors. Ever wondered why the senior engineers job-hop less?

Our happiness should not come from belittling other professions and our sadness should not come from developing an inferiority complex from other professions. Life has many more important undertones like finding a hobby, a life-long enthusiasm for something or surviving this pandemic.

Harshit.
