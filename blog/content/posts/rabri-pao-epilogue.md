"It might be impossible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense. It would be a description without meaning- as if you describe Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure."  
-Albert Einstein.  

I have come a long way. I have a long way to go.  
Hold my hands when I fall and when I shiver.

### Rabri Pao - Epilogue

Rabri Pao is a poem very close to my heart. I remember I posted a hateful monologue on justifying Nazis even if that meant living truly for your people. A genuine soul and a friend corrected me and I obliged. I'm grateful to him.

This poem summarises my experience with spirituality and my eventual love from atheism to a very personal and very intimate version of God. Growing up I found most people incapable of answering or questioning the concept of God in the right way. I think my journey has been worthwhile and I think I claim my way to be the right way. Another heretic with a new religion. Keep it or abandon it.

There was this question in my head for a very long time. Is there a chance that some version of God does exist? Or is God just one of the thousands of human inventions in our history? I have been an atheist for a very long time. More than a thoughtful decade. I always found this world to be a godless world even after all that is good in the world. It remains that never-ending centuries-old philosophical debate if we humans are inherently good or inherently bad. I always let rationality and science take the first place. I do not find God in a mindless ritual. Let me correct myself. A ritual performed mindlessly. I've seen good people believe and perform harmless rituals. I have seen bad people not believe and never performing any ritual.

Rabri Pao

"I stood near Sarnath in northeast Varanasi  
Devouring on a plate of Rabri Pao  
Again and again for a while.  
Cooked on coal, it tasted divine."  

These lines are from a very pristine memory of my travel experience from Varanasi. Rabri Pao cooked on coal was one of the best roadside food I ate in a long time. The lines are also metaphorical. If a God exists, why didn't He made us completely savages like other animals. Why bless and curse humankind with a conscience. More specifically, a consciousness. We can be so cruel not only to other species but to each other as well. Yet we can be kind. We can be thoughtful. We can be good. We can be surprisingly honest. We can bring devastation in a war and we can create suffering in an immeasurable way. We can also create art. We can sacrifice for a cause. No other animal sacrifices for a cause. Science doesn't answer pain and suffering more effectively. So, most of us fall for pseudo-science and a facade of a reason.

There are many different interpretations for each major religion, many different theology books and works of rigour penned by hundreds of intellectuals over centuries. Like Rabri Pao, I have been devouring good works of literature from across religions and thoughts of schools. Picking the good parts from them. Trying to imbibe some of them initially and aiming to imbibe more of them with time. Some works feel so fresh and so astoundingly untouched by all the hatred in the world. I admire them. I admire they existed at some point in spacetime. By being cooked on coal, I mean that my strong conviction is that the concept of God is also a human invention. It's cooked on coal, in our reality, with the presence of all atmospheric pollution that has always plagued its presence. Yet when I focus solely on the taste of the Rabri Pao, it helps me. It heals me. It calms me.

There is a plethora of good and bad stuff in the literature and available at a distance from one Google search. Even if God doesn't exist, I respect that despite our basic instincts and a pitiless Universe, if some good people believe in some version of God and that helps them to be a better person without shoving their belief systems down the throats of others and without letting it become a symbol of their inner boiling hatred for themselves and the world, then, for me it is not a question of whether God exists or not anymore. I'll accept that maybe God is one of the most powerful and beautiful inventions of humankind. Let's be better than what nature has made us. Humanity is the greatest religion.

"Now, that image flickers in my mind  
During late-night contemplations.  

Maybe, I would have decided that  
This Universe is a pitiless place  
And for all its glamour, all its glitz,  
Nihilistic oblivion with no meaning.  

Truth is a bit like coal."  

Nihilism is okay but it doesn't solve problems. Thousands of lives were sacrificed for the end of evils like slavery and colonialism so that we can breathe free air. Everything has a history of pain, endurance and perseverance. No powerful government is going to preserve our Freedom Of Speech. It is not in their interests. No powerful corporation wants you to know the truth and corner them into answerability. We are mocked by our own demons. We are mocked by the persistent forces who want to see our world crumble into ashes. The fight is always going to be there.

Wait and rest. Rest when you're tired and feel overwhelmed. Take a Rabri Pao with you when the presence of Coal seems overpowering.

Dragon.
